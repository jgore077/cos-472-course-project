# cos-472-course-project
Our source code for the COS 472 course project. We are working with this Kaggle [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use/overview).

# Data
To get our data you first must install the `kaggle` command line tool with this command
```
pip install kaggle
```
Then you need to download the data with this command
```
kaggle competitions download -c child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use
```
After downloading the data you will need to unzip the zip file to this directory: `data/`. Our code assumes that the dataset is located here.
